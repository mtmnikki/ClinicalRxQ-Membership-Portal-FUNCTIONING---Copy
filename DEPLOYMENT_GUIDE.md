# ClinicalRxQ Membership Portal - Deployment Guide

## Project Status

✅ **React TypeScript app now properly configured with Vite and ready for deployment!**

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Examined project structure 
2. ✅ Ran development server successfully
3. ✅ Tested Supabase API connection - working properly
4. ✅ Fixed all TypeScript errors
5. ✅ **Migrated from esbuild to Vite** for proper React TypeScript support
6. ✅ Built optimized production bundle in `/dist` folder

## Build System

**Updated from esbuild to Vite** for better React TypeScript experience:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation with proper type checking
- ✅ React hot module replacement (HMR) in development
- ✅ Optimized production builds with code splitting
- ✅ Source maps for debugging

## Development vs Production

### Development (Vite):
- `npm run dev` - Fast development server with HMR on http://localhost:3000
- TypeScript type checking included
- Hot reload on file changes

### Legacy (esbuild):
- `npm run dev:esbuild` - Original esbuild development server
- `npm run build:esbuild` - Original esbuild production build

## Deployment Files

The production-ready files are located in the `/dist` folder:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file with proper module imports
- `assets/main-[hash].js` - Optimized JavaScript bundle with source maps
- `assets/main-[hash].css` - Compiled CSS with Tailwind

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting (Recommended)
Since this is a single-page application, you can deploy to any static hosting service:

#### Vercel
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run: `vercel --prod`
3. Follow the prompts

#### Netlify
1. Install Netlify CLI: `npm i -g netlify-cli`
2. Run: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist`

#### GitHub Pages
1. Install gh-pages: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
2. Add to package.json scripts: `"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"`
3. Run: `npm run deploy`

### Option 2: Traditional Web Server
Upload the contents of the `/dist` folder to your web server's public directory.

### Option 3: Cloud Platforms

#### AWS S3 + CloudFront
1. Create S3 bucket with static website hosting
2. Upload dist/* files
3. Set up CloudFront distribution

#### Google Cloud Storage
1. Create storage bucket
2. Upload dist/* files
3. Enable public access

## Environment Variables

The app uses the following Supabase configuration (already built into the code):
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: https://xeyfhlmflsibxzjsirav.supabase.co
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: (anon key is embedded)

## Pre-deployment Checklist

- [x] All TypeScript errors fixed
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Supabase connection tested
- [x] Production bundle created
- [ ] Domain/hosting service selected
- [ ] SSL certificate configured (if applicable)

## Post-deployment Steps

1. **Test the live site** - Verify all features work in production
2. **Monitor Supabase usage** - Check your Supabase dashboard for API usage
3. **Set up monitoring** - Consider tools like Sentry for error tracking
4. **Configure CDN** - For better global performance

## Security Considerations

1. The Supabase anon key is public by design - it's safe to expose
2. Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) is properly configured in Supabase
3. Consider implementing rate limiting on your hosting platform

## Support

For issues with:
- **Supabase**: Check the Supabase dashboard and logs
- **Build errors**: Run `npm run build` and check for errors
- **Runtime errors**: Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
